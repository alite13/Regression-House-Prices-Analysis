## Generated plots are here  
These are examples of all plots generated while running the training part of the code. Plots are the following:  
- Percentage of missing values in each numerical column    
- Percentage of missing values in each categorical column  
- Scatter plots of the dependent feature vs each of the independent feature    
- Boxplot of all features
- Histograms of all original and transformed features  
- Interaction plots  
- Influential observations (generated after running OLS in training mode)  
- Residuals vs fitted values (generated after running OLS in training mode) 
- Residuals vs leverage (generated after running OLS in training mode)   
- Predicted vs actual values (3 plots generated after running OLS, Robust Regression, and NN in training mode)  
- Q-Q plot (generated after running OLS in training mode)  
- P-P plot (generated after running OLS in training mode)
