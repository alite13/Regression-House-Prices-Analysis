## Generated models are here   
There are 3 generated robust regression models that are used for making predictions either individually or in the ensemble. There is one OLS regression generated model and one neural network regressor.  
These are examples of the models generated while running the training part of the code, therefore, these are not the best-obtained models used for my particular Kaggle submission.
